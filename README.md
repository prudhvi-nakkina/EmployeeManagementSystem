The objective of the Employee Management System is to overcome the complexities of handling different types of employee data of a company. The Employee Management System contains information about the different branches of a company and the different departments within a branch. This system can also be used to get information about all the employees of the company like the employee’s branch and department. Through this system an employee can check details about his/her personal information, earned leaves and assigned manager. This system also provides a manager role who has a group of employees under him and can initiate a transfer of employee to different department. A system admin can analyze all the data related to the company.
